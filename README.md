# xored_task

## Usage

Go to http://p-himik.ru and experiment.
Note that the chart may be rather slow though, but the correct time will still be shown on the X axis.

If you want to experiment in REPL either download this project and use it
(Leiningen >= 2.0.0, Clojure >= 1.5.1, opt. Eclipse with Counterclockwise plugin)
or ask me and I'll forward the port.
